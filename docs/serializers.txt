Serializers
Serializers are responsible for converting complex data such as querysets 
and model instances to nativ python datatypes(called serialization) that can
then be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types  which is 
understandable by Frontend. 

Serializers are also responsible for deserialization which means it allows for
data to be converted back into complex data types, after first validation in incoming data.
